hey colin!

basic structure here is puppet.html loads all the js dependencies in head
and then puppet.js is where the action happens. im just curling dependencies
into this dir, so if you want to add other libs, throw em in here.

im just adding things below as i think of them:

- if you want to try some different puppets, you can just cp -r this dir, i figure that gives
tovi more flexibility to A/B puppets
