this looks promising: https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_facebook_login

songbarker app id: `2622706171384608`

youll need to insert the facebook app id into some config files for each platform and do some random stuff outlined in the docs for that library

once the stuff is all configured, its pretty similar to google- you make a request using this library to facebook, then send me the token.
