welcome back-

cloud to_sequence implementation
- port scripts to .cloud-env
- add to requirements.txt
- work out signature needed for function
- write cloud server endpoint
- build and deploy to cluster
- write regular server endpoint with db bookkeeping

do a little reading on the details of pods/instances/services/clusters/app and
the difference between them, for tuning and whatnot
